# ZooGUI

Welcome to **ZooGUI** â€“ a comprehensive Java application that simulates a digital zoo environment. This project showcases advanced object-oriented programming concepts, the Strategy design pattern, and modular software architecture, all within an engaging animal simulation.

## Features

- **Diverse Animal Collection:** Includes mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, and arachnids, each with unique behaviors.
- **Behavioral Flexibility:** Implements the Strategy pattern, allowing animals to have interchangeable eating, moving, and sound behaviors.
- **Scalable Design:** Easily extend the zoo by adding new animals or behaviors with minimal code changes.
- **(Optional) Graphical User Interface:** Interact with the zoo through a user-friendly GUI (if implemented).

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (OOP, interfaces, inheritance)
- **Design Patterns:** Strategy Pattern for animal behaviors
- **(Optional) Java Swing/JavaFX** for GUI components

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZooGUI.git`
2. **Open the project** in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. **Compile and run `Main.java`.**
4. **(If GUI is implemented):** Launch the GUI to explore and interact with the zoo.

## Animal Roster

- **Bears:** Brown Bear, Black Bear
- **Felines:** Lion, Ocelot
- **Monkeys:** Orangutan, Baboon
- **Canines:** Wolf, Hyena
- **Arachnids:** Black Widow, Scorpion
- **Insects:** Praying Mantis, Dung Beetle
- **Birds:** Robin, Parrot
- **Penguins:** Emperor, King
- **Reptiles:** Snake, Komodo Dragon
- **Fish:** Salmon, Shark

## Learning Objectives

- Master the use of interfaces and abstract classes in Java
- Apply the Strategy design pattern to real-world scenarios
- Organize and scale large object-oriented projects
- (Optional) Develop interactive GUIs in Java
